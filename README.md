# Nightingale
Tell me the patient's symptoms, I'll help you treat him


## AI for Primary Health Care

Use her to catalog possible sicknesses a patient might have, helping you to investigate the correct diagnosis as well as determine the right treatment

### Ideas
Possible Multiclassifier where each label(y) will correspond to a disease, while each feature(X) will correspond to symptoms. The AI will determine the probability of
each disease being the correct diagnosis and will show up in a list every disease that has a probability higher than 1% of being the correct one, as well as the
probability it deduced.

* Problem: Not every patient develops the same symptoms for the same sickness. How to make the AI take this factor into account during training and while in action?
* Considering this, how can one mount the data in order for the AI to be properly trained? A single dataframe where each disease is assigned to many symptoms column?
Or perhaps organizing it in a better way(which I have no idea right now). How can one add more data in order to test it?
* OBS: Perhaps 1% will still show up too much information. It might be interesting to let the user itself to decide this number.
* ProblemÂ²: Considering we want to deal with human lives, what is the minimum accuracy that the model must have? How big should the dataset be?

## Further Development
Making Nightingale not only say the diagnosis, but also the active ingredient that can treat such sickness
